# Overview

Hangman is a command-line game where players guess a hidden word. Users will be able to input a specific letter that will be compared to the letters of the hidden word, if the letter is in the word then their respective positions will be revealed. Once all letters are revelaed, the player wins and the game ends.

The purpose of this software is to serve a recreational program that teaches the functionality of word processing and user/input interaction. Also works as a baseline to create a more complex hangman game.
